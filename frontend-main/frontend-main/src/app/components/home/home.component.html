    <p>
      Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a
      universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure
      that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. There are 17 SDGs with
      169 targets that cover a range of interconnected issues, including
      poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water and
      sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth,
      industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable
      cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate
      action, life below water, life on land, peace, justice and strong
      institutions, and partnerships for the goals. On this page, you will find
      information on each SDG, its targets, and what actions you can take to
      help achieve the SDGs.
