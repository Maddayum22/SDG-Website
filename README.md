# What I did for this project
In this project I was responsible for the following parts:
- Server setup, the base of the server and later the configuration to easily switch between two databases, one that uses an ORM and one that uses SQL queries.
- The base OOP structure, Routing, Server setup, layers and classes.
- The posts structure, from creating a post, to getting all the posts etc.
- The session authentication and creation. Both the cookie management and saving the info in a database.
- Unit, Integration and E2E Testing for post and session structure.
- Database configuration and other database management.
- A lot of frontend work.
- Setup for sequelize models.
- Bug fixing and helping other with their code.
